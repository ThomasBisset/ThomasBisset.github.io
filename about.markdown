Hi. I'm Tom. Only my mum calls me Thomas. Go with he/him/his. 

Former retail slave, now a hearing aid dispenser. Also now studying Computing and IT (following the software development track). 

[Used to do a lot of photography](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/?name=Thomas+Bisset&pseudoid=F02E6378-0117-46D5-9353-BE63D9F0C2B4&sortBy=relevant), back in the day. 

Music lover, plays bass guitar very badly, regular D&D player (with some fingers dipped in the Dungeon / Game Master pie), all around nerd.
