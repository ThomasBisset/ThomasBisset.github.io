# fortune-cah
A silly little Python script that generates various black and white card combinations from the hit game Cards Against Humanity in the terminal. Can get quite NSFW. Inspired somewhat by the old Unix program `fortune`.

# cephalolog
Another simple Python script to pull out information from the Octopus Energy API. Potentially useful if you would like to get more information about your energy use than your smart meter allows.

# ACC_Data_2
And another Python script to pull real-time data from the racing sim *Assetto Corsa Competitzione* and log it for future analysis. I don't play ACC very much these days so I'm unlikely to put much effort into improving this, and frankly I'd probably want to re-do it in another language anyway to make it more performant.

# AfterEdit
Now archived as no longer used, this script would effectively mass resize, insert appropriate IPTC data and selectively add a watermark to some images instead of seperately exporting images where the client's requirements differed.
